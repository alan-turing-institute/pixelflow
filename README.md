Pixelflow is a tool for extracting information about the characteristics of objects in images. Segmentation models can be used to identify objects, but researchers typically then want to obtain more details about these objects, e.g. their number, size, shape etc. Pixelflow aims to simplify this process, working with a mask from 2D or 3D images and outputting a dataframe of the desired characteristics.

It is part of the [scivision](https://sci.vision) library of tools for working with computer vision models and data.

An example usecase of pixelflow, extracting information on seed size and shape, can be found in the [scivision-gallery](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/pixelflow_seed_demo).
